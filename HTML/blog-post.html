            <h2>What is AlgoCoin?</h2>
            <p>
                AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary <strong>proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm</strong>
                that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the
                metaverse to its next major stage: <em>Web 4.0</em>. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of
                hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time
                of usage through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree
                equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420
                AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.

            <h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
            <p>
                Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We
                recommend starting out by practicing on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.algoexpert.io">AlgoExpert</a>.
                Next, once you feel

                you can invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's
                time to ditch your fiat currency and enter the future.
